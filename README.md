# Python Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **Python DSA** repository! This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Python, along with explanations, time complexities, and real-world applications.

## Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Sets

### 2. Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, etc.)
- Backtracking (N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

### 3. Complexity Analysis
- Explanation of Time and Space Complexity (Big O notation)
- Best, Average, and Worst Case Scenarios for each algorithm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
