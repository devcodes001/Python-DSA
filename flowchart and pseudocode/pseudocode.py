end

Flowchart 
1. Flowchart is a graphical representation of a processs,system or algorithm
2. It uses symbols and arrows to show the sequence of steps needed to complete a task
3. Flow chart are useful in visualising how to solve a problem and make the process easier to follow

Process to solve a problem (input,output,constraint)
1. Analyze your problem
2. Break down problem into smaller subports
3. Remember/enlist the concept.
4. Take 2-3 examples. (clear out confusion/gap)
5. write a pseudocode on a paper.
6. Dry run it 
7. write down your solution
8. Look out for edge cases \ boundary condition.**
